# human_pose_estimation
Introduction 
The recent methods of estimating the human posture in two-dimensional space based on deep learning have shown better applicability and results than before. However, the problem also faced many different challenges such as in crowds, resolution, lighting, ... In this project, I analyze and evaluate pros and cons of the article “Pifpaf: Composite Fields For Human Pose Estimation ”, the author has focused on solving the challenge of occluded and low resolution. I analyze on different datasets: COCO dataset, in addition I analyze errors on 1000 MPII images, 2000 images of sports dataset collected by us. Thereby having a more general view of the article, and thereby giving directions to develop research to improve the article.
